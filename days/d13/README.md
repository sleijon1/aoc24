I was tricked by the idea of the fewest tokens making me think it's an optimization problem. Of course, it's a simple equation system with 2 equations 2 unknowns, so there is a single solution. Then implement any basic formula for solving linear equation e.g. [Cramesr](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramers_regel) or use lib like I did.
