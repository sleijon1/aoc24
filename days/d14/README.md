Part 1 is a straightforward simple solution but part b was interesting since it meant you had to look at a bunch of images since my solution was >6000 seconds meaning 6000 images to look at. Went pretty fast by just going into gallery view and scrolling since the image is so clear:

[christmas_tree](christmas_tree.png)

But since you don't know it will be so obvious beforehand I scrutinized the images thoroughly to look for a resemblance of the tree. But most likely it will always be very obvious since I doubt they would make a problem where some difficulty lies in visual inspection, but that is of course an assumption.


The windows file explorer is super slow at viewing images fast. Maybe it would be better to use some terminal tool visualization
