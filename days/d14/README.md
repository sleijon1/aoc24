Part 1 is a straightforward simple solution but part b was interesting since it meant you had to look at a bunch of images since my solution was >6000 seconds meaning 6000 images to look at. Went pretty fast by just going into gallery view and scrolling since the image is so clear:

But since you don't know it will be so obvious beforehand I scrutinized the images thoroughly to look for a resemblance of the tree.
